The _IfcTunnelDomain_ schema defines specific object concepts used in the tunnel domain that have not been covered in other schemas.
The scope for _IfcTunnelDomain_ is based on the industryâ€™s definition of tunnels, such as: Underground/underwater structures (DIN 1076), Artificial underground passage (Oxford Dictionary), Underground structure excavated to create a communication (UIC), Long enclosed transport route (PIARC) & Underground structures, shafts, chambers, passageways & cut and cover excavations (OSHA).

> NOTE&nbsp; Most elements used in the tunnel domain are shared with other domains and are consequently declared in other schemas.

Specific tunnel elements that are not already covered by other schemas are defined here:

* spatial structure types for breaking down tunnel projects.
