A potentially overlapping linear element that represents a sub section (from-to) of an _IfcLinearPositioningElement_ (_IfcAlignment_) and as such typically carry properties (e.g. desing properties) that varies along the length of the _IfcLinearPositioningElement_.

> NOTE&nbsp; May be used as a lean way for infrastructure projects to describe e.g. existing or desired conditions at sections along the alignment such as ground conditions, excavation measures, support types, design parameters etc.

> NOTE&nbsp; A linear zone is not required to, but may, carry its own independent shape representation.
