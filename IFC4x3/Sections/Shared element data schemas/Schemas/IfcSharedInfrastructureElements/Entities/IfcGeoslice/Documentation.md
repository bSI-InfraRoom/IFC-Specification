Representation of the concept of a sectional planar geological and geotechnical model, usually an interpretation but sometimes created direct from ground penetrating measurement. The assembly may contain one of more strata and anthropic elements. The contained subtypes of _IfcGeotechnicalStratum_ will have shape representations made from polygons reflecting the visible section or poly lines if a 'Yabuki' top surface model is being used.

> DEPRECATION&nbsp; The entity _IfcGeoSlice_ shall not be used anymore, use _IfcGeoScienceModel_ instead.
