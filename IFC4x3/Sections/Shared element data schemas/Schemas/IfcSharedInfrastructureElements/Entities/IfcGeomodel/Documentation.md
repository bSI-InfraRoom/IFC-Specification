Representation of the concept of a volumetric geological and geotechnical model, usually an interpretation but sometimes created direct from ground penetrating measurement.
The assembly may contain one of more strata and other anthropic elements. The contained subtypes of _IfcGeotechnicalStratum_ will have shape representations made from polyhedra or surfaces if a 'Yabuki' top surface model is being used.

> DEPRECATION&nbsp; The entity _IfcGeomodel_ shall not be used anymore, use _IfcGeoScienceModel_ instead.
