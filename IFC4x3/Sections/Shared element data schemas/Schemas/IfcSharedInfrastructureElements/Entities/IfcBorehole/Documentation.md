A Borehole is the generalized term for any narrow shaft drilled in the ground, either vertically, horizontally, or inclined. 

> NOTE&nbsp; In the context of ground models, IfcBorehole is mainly used as a space where observations of the ground conditions are made, and results from tests in place (in-situ) or on samples collected from the borehole are located.

> NOTE&nbsp; The IfcBorehole may aggregate other elements such as installations and lining and have IfcGeoScienceObservation instances assigned to represent e.g. intervals and points. Further, the IfcGeoScienceObservation instances can represent the ground classification described by IfcGeoScienceModel, and link a certain part (interval) of the borehole to an IfcGeoScienceFeature like a geotechnical unit. 

> NOTE&nbsp; The assembly may also contain one or more strata. The contained subtypes of _IfcGeotechnicalStratum_ will have shape representations made from straight or bent tubes reflecting the bore diameter, or discs if a 'Yabuki' top surface model is being used.
