Gradient curve is a type of curve 3D curve representation that is based on its 2D projection (BaseCurve) and a height defined by its gradient segments which can be derived from a function that retrieves it from the segment start height, its placement and the ParentCurve instance and the type of the ParentCurve.

The parametrization of the gradient curve is based on the underlying segments of its _BaseCurve_. The value of the parameter equals the parameter value of _BaseCurve_.
