The Bloss curve is a curve definition used in particular in rail transitions. It was proposed by Dr. Ing. Bloss.

It's parametrization is as follows:
X coordinate:  
![Image](../../figures/ifctransitioncurvetype-blosscurve-x.png)  
Y coordinate:  
![Image](../../figures/ifctransitioncurvetype-blosscurve-y.png)

where &Theta; is the deflection or bearing angle.

The curvature of the curve is calculated as.

K = K0 (s³/QubicTerm³ + s²/QuadraticTerm² + s/LinearTerm
where
K ... curvature
K0 ... start curvature
