An _IfcMapConversionScaled_ is a type of _IfcMapConversion_ that along with an EPSG code supplies a constant scale factor for coordinate conversion. The usage is restricted to when constant scale factors are explicitly exchanged. Typically, these are relatively speaking smaller facilities such as buildings where a constant scale factor is agreed on a project.
