	<Documentation>Detecting the surface effects produced by electric current flow in the ground.  Using electrical methods, one may measure potentials, currents, and electromagnetic fields that occur naturally or are introduced artificially in the ground. The variation in electrical resistivity found in different rocks and minerals makes these techniques possible.</Documentation>
