	<Documentation>The referent represents where an administrative or maintenance boundary crosses the linear element being measured. This is typically the first time the boundary crosses the linear element. If the boundary runs along the linear element, it would be the point at which they first become collinear. The LRS should include specific rules about how boundaries are handled if this type of referent is permitted. If the linear element changes at the boundary as for a county route beginning at the county boundary, then the LRM is more correctly categorized as absolute.
