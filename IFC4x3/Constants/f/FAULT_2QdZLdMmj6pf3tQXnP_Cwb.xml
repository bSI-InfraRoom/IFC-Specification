	<Documentation>A shear displacement structure includes all brittle to ductile style structures along which displacement has occurred, from a simple, single &apos;planar&apos; surface to a fault system comprised of tens of strands of both brittle and ductile nature. This structure may have some significant thickness (a deformation zone) and have an associated body of deformed rock that may be considered a deformation unit (which geologicUnitType is ‘DeformationUnit’) which can be associated to the ShearDisplacementStructure using GeologicFeatureRelation from the GeoSciML Extension package</Documentation>
