	<Documentation>A fold is formed by one or more systematically curved layers, surfaces, or lines in a rock body. A fold denotes a structure formed by the deformation of a geologic structure, such as a contact of which the original undeformed geometry is presumed, to form a structure that may be described by the translation of an abstract line (the fold axis) parallel to itself along some curvilinear path (the fold profile). Folds have a hinge zone (zone of maximum curvature along the surface) and limbs (parts of the deformed surface not in the hinge zone). Folds are described by an axial surface, hinge line, profile geometry, the solid angle between the limbs, and the relationships between adjacent folded surfaces if the folded structure is a layering fabric.</Documentation>
