Relative placement to positioning element.

Any _IfcProduct_ may have a direct reference to the _IfcAlignment_ on which it is placed. This is an exception where no measurements in the form of stationing values are required. The placement is always relative to the underlying _IfcAlignment_.Representation (allowed geometric items are certain types of curves) with an absolute measurement from the start of the representing curve at zero parameter length.
