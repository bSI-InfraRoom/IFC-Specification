The _Surface 3D Geometry_ is the standard surfacic represenation for elements having a 'Surface' representation describing the inner or outer surface of the object, e.g. for defining thermal boundaries idealized at the middle plane of an element.

The following attribute values for the _IfcShapeRepresentation_ holding this geometric representation shall be used:

* _IfcShapeRepresentation_._RepresentationIdentifier_ = 'Surface'
* _IfcShapeRepresentation_._RepresentationType_ = 'Surface3D'
* _IfcShapeRepresentation_._Items_ = _IfcBoundedSurface_, _IfcSweptSurface_
