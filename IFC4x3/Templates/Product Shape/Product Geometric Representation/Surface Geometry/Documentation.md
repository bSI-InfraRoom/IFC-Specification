Elements may have a 'Surface' representation describing the outer surface of the object. Such representation may be used for hit-testing objects having part composition such as framed walls, or for defining thermal boundaries idealized at the middle plane of an element.

The representation identifier of the surface representation is:

* _IfcShapeRepresentation_._RepresentationIdentifier_ = 'Surface'
