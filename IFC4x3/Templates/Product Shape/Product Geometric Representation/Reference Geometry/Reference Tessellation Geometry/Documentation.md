The _Reference Tessellation Geometry_ is the reference representation of the 3D shape of a product by using tessellated models. Being a reference representation it is normally not displayed and it is not used in a voiding relationship.

The following attribute values for the _IfcShapeRepresentation_ holding this geometric representation shall be used:

* _IfcShapeRepresentation_._RepresentationIdentifier_ = 'Reference'
* _IfcShapeRepresentation_._RepresentationType_ = 'Tessellation'
* _IfcShapeRepresentation_._Items_ = _IfcTessellatedFaceSet_
