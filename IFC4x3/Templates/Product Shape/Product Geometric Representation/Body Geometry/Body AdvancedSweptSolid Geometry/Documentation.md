The _Body AdvancedSweptSolid Geometry_ is the representation of the 3D shape of a product by swept solid models, including advanced sweeping operations, such as sweeping along any directrix and tapering.

The following attribute values for the _IfcShapeRepresentation_ holding this geometric representation shall be used:

* _IfcShapeRepresentation_._RepresentationIdentifier_ = 'Body'
* _IfcShapeRepresentation_._RepresentationType_ = 'AdvancedSweptSolid'
* _IfcShapeRepresentation_._Items_ = _IfcSweptAreaSolid_, _IfcSweptDiskSolid_
