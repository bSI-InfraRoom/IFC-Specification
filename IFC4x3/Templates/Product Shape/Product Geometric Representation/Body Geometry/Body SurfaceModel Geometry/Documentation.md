The _Body SurfaceModel Geometry_ is the representation of the 3D shape of a product by surface models.

The following attribute values for the _IfcShapeRepresentation_ holding this geometric representation shall be used:

* _IfcShapeRepresentation_._RepresentationIdentifier_ = 'Body'
* _IfcShapeRepresentation_._RepresentationType_ = 'SurfaceModel'
* _IfcShapeRepresentation_._Items_ = _IfcTessellateditem_, _IfcShellBasedSurfaceModel_, _IfcFaceBasedSurfaceModel_
