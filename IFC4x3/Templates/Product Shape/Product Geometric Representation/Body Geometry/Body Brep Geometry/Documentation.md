The _Body Brep Geometry_ is the representation of the 3D shape of a product by faceted boundary representation models.

The following attribute values for the _IfcShapeRepresentation_ holding this geometric representation shall be used:

* _IfcShapeRepresentation_._RepresentationIdentifier_ = 'Body'
* _IfcShapeRepresentation_._RepresentationType_ = 'Brep'
* _IfcShapeRepresentation_._Items_ = _IfcFacetedBrep_
