The _Body Clipping Geometry_ is the representation of the 3D shape of a product by using Constructive Solid Geometry models with difference operations involving half space solids only.

The following attribute values for the _IfcShapeRepresentation_ holding this geometric representation shall be used:

* _IfcShapeRepresentation_._RepresentationIdentifier_ = 'Body'
* _IfcShapeRepresentation_._RepresentationType_ = 'Clipping'
* _IfcShapeRepresentation_._Items_ = _IfcBooleanClippingResult_

> NOTE&nbsp; This representation type is predominately used for compatibility with previous releases of the standard.
