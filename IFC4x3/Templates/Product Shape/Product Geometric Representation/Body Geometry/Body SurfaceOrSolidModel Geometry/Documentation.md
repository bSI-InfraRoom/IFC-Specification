The _Body SurfaceOrSolidModel Geometry_ is the representation of the 3D shape of a product by surface or solid models and allows for a mixed representation.

The following attribute values for the _IfcShapeRepresentation_ holding this geometric representation shall be used:

* _IfcShapeRepresentation_._RepresentationIdentifier_ = 'Body'
* _IfcShapeRepresentation_._RepresentationType_ = 'SurfaceOrSolidModel'
* _IfcShapeRepresentation_._Items_ = _IfcTessellateditem_, _IfcShellBasedSurfaceModel_, _IfcFaceBasedSurfaceModel_, _IfcSolidModel_
