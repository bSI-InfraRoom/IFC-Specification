The _Body SweptSolid Geometry_ is the representation of the 3D shape of a product by swept solid models, only allowing for the basic extruded area solids and revolved area solids.

The following attribute values for the _IfcShapeRepresentation_ holding this geometric representation shall be used:

* _IfcShapeRepresentation_._RepresentationIdentifier_ = 'Body'
* _IfcShapeRepresentation_._RepresentationType_ = 'SweptSolid'
* _IfcShapeRepresentation_._Items_ = _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid_, _IfcRevolvedAreaSolid_
