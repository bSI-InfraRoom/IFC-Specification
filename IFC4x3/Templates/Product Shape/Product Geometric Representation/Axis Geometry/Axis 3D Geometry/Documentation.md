The 'Axis' representation using 'Curve3D' representation type is predominately used to align material profile sets to geometric representations of standard beams, columns, members, pipes, ducts and other longitudinal elements.

The following attribute values for the _IfcShapeRepresentation_ holding this geometric representation shall be used:

* _IfcShapeRepresentation_._RepresentationIdentifier_ = 'Axis'
* _IfcShapeRepresentation_._RepresentationType_ : 'Curve3D'
* _IfcShapeRepresentation_._Items_ = _IfcBoundedCurve_
