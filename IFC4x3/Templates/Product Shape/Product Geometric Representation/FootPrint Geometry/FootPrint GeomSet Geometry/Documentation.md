The 'FootPrint GeomSet Geometry' is the standard representation for the floor plan projection of the geometric representation of elements, comprising of mainly 2D curves

The following attribute values for the _IfcShapeRepresentation_ holding this geometric representation are used:

* _IfcShapeRepresentation_._RepresentationIdentifier_ : 'FootPrint'
* _IfcShapeRepresentation_._RepresentationType_ : 'GeometricCurveSet'
* _IfcShapeRepresentation_._Items_ : _IfcGeometricCurveSet_
