The 'Annotation 3D Geometry' is used, when the representation of the annotation does includes surfaces and is not restricted to two-dimensional representation items.

The following attribute values for the _IfcShapeRepresentation_ holding this geometric representation shall be used:

*  _IfcShapeRepresentation_._RepresentationIdentifier_ : 'Annotation' 
*  _IfcShapeRepresentation_._RepresentationType_ : 'GeometricSet' 
* _IfcShapeRepresentation_._Items_ : 
    * subtypes of _IfcPoint_ and _IfcCurve_ being three-dimensional and within an _IfcGeometricSet_
    * subtypes of _IfcSurface_ being three-dimensional and within an _IfcGeometricSet_
