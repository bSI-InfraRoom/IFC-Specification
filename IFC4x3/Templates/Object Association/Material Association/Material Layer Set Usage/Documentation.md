Material layer set usage defines layout at occurrences to indicate a direction and offset from the 'Axis' reference curve, and a reference extent such as for a default wall height.

The concept of _Material Layer Set Usage_ is only applicable to certain product subtypes, refered to as "Standard case" elements. It supports a certain range of parametric definitions for those element configurations.

The material of those standard case elements is defined by _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_ and is attached by the _IfcRelAssociatesMaterial_._RelatingMaterial_. It is accessible by the inverse _HasAssociations_ relationship. Standard case elements with multiple layers can be represented by refering to several _IfcMaterialLayer_'s within the _IfcMaterialLayerSet_ that is referenced from the _IfcMaterialLayerUsage_.
