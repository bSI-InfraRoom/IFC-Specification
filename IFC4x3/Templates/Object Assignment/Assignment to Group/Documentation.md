The _Assignment to Group_ established the assignment of an object to a group, being an arbitrary collection of objects. It is the complementary concept template to _Group Assignment_ defining how object are assigned by a group.

The grouping relationship does not apply any other meaning then grouping objects under some aspect. It is non-hierarchical, meaning that objects can be assigned to many groups, and it does not interfere with other relationship concepts, such as _Element Decomposition_.
