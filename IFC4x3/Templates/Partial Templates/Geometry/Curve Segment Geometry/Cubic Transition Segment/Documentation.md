The cubic transition segment is modelled with _IfcPolynomialCurve_ with certain restrictions. The size of the attribute CoefficientsY is restricted to 4. The cubic term is on position 4. In general, the CoefficietsX size would be restricted to 2 and values specified as [0, 1]. This produces the following result:

y = CoefficientsX[3]*xÂ³, where other values in CoefficientsY are 0.
