The sine transition segment is a special case of a spiral where the curvature rate of change is a sine function and the terms are dependent on the length L measured from the inflection point. The parameter value is defined as the deflection i.e. bearing angle &Theta.

The values of its individual terms are identical and equal to the lenght of the segment L:
SineTerm = L
LinearTerm = L
