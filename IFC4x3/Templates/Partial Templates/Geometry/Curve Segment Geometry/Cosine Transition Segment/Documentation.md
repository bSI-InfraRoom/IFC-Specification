The cosine transition segment is a special case of a spiral where the curvature rate of change is a cosine function and the terms are dependent on the length L measured from the inflection point. The parameter value is defined as the deflection i.e. bearing angle &Theta.

The values of its individual terms dependent on segment length L:
CosineTerm = L
Constant = 1
