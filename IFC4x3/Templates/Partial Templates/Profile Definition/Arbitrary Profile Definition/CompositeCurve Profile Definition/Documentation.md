Composite curve profile definitons define the closed two-dimensional curve used for the cross-section by a composite curve, consisting of multiple composite curve segments. Each composite curve segment has a parent curve, being either a polyline or a trimmed curve. Trimmed curves have basis curves of type line, circle or ellipse.
