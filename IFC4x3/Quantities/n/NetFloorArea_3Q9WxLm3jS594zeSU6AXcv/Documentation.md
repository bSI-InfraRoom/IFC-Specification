Sum of all net usable floor areas.


<!-- comment -->


It excludes the area covered by elements inside the space (columns, inner walls, built-in's etc.), slab openings, or other protruding elements. Varying heights are not taking into account (i.e. no reduction for areas under a minimum headroom).
