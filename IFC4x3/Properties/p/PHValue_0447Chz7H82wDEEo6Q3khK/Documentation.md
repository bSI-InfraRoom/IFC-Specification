In chemistry, pH historically denoting "potential of hydrogen" (or "power of hydrogen"), is a scale used to specify the acidity or basicity of an aqueous solution. Acidic solutions (solutions with higher concentrations of H+ ions) are measured to have lower pH values than basic or alkaline solutions. pH (potential of hydrogen) is the measure of the activity of hydrogen ions in solution. pH value is logarithm to the base 10 of the ratio of the molar hydrogen-ion activity (aH) multiplied by -1.
