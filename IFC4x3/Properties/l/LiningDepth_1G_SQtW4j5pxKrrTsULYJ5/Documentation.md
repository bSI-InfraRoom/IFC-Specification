The depth of the lining.

For a door, it is the depth of the door lining, measured perpendicular to the plane of the door lining. If omitted (and with a given value to lining thickness) it indicates an adjustable depth (i.e. a depth that adjusts to the thickness of the wall into which the occurrence of this door style is inserted).
