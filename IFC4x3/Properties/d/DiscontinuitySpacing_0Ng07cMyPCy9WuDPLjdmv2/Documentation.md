The term "spacing" refers to the mean or modal spacing of a set of discontinuities and is the perpendicular distance between adjacent discontinuities. The number of discontinuity sets, the differences in spacing and the angles between the sets shall be reported as these determine the block shape. The discontinuity spacing should be measured in millimetres and can be classified using the terms in Table 8.
