A quantity defined for a mode of propagation at a given frequency in a specific uniform transmission line or uniform waveguide by one of the three following relations: Z1 = S/ |I|2 Z2 = |U|2 / S Z3 = U / I where Z is the complex characteristic impedance, S the complex power and U and I are the values, usually complex, respectively of a voltage and a current conventionally defined for each type of mode by analogy with transmission line equations.
