Soil effective stress friction angle is a shear strength parameter of soils. Its definition is derived from the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion and it is used to describe the friction shear resistance of soils with the normal effective stress. The residual value correspond to the shear strength measured at large strain values during the test.
