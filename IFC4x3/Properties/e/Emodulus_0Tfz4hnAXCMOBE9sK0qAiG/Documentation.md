The elastic modulus (E-modulus) is a measure of the ground stiffness, describing the extent to which a material resists deformation in response to an applied force. It is defined as the ratio of the stress along an axis to the strain along that axis in the range of elastic behaviour. This property can be measured directly or derived with correlations from many different types of laboratory and in-situ test methods and is used in constitutive models for soil and rock. Many alternative and corresponding parameters describe the ground stiffness, including elastic and plastic behaviour and depending on strain (non-linear behavior), loading/unloading conditions, dynamic/static conditions, drained/undrained conditions. Such specific parameters can be defined in IFC models with custom property sets depending on the exchange scenario (e.g. for specific test results or geomechanical properties of interpreted models and materials).
