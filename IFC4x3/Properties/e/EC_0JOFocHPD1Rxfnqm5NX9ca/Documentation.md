Electric conductivity. The reciprocal of the resistance, measured under specified conditions, between the opposite faces of a unit cube of defined dimensions of an aqueous solution. For water quality examination, this is often expressed as "electrical conductivity" and may be used as a measure of the concentration of ionizable solutes present in the sample.
