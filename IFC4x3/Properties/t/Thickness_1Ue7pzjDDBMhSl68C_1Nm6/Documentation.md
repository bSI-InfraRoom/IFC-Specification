The nominal thickness of the pavement. The size information is provided in addition to the shape representation and the geometric parameters used within. In case of inconsistency between the geometric parameters and the size properties, provided in the attached property set, the geometric parameters take precedence. It is regarded as constant thickness of the pavement, unless property ThicknessEnd is provided, in which case Thickness shall be regarded as the value at the beginning of a transition (usually at the object placement location). Example of such case is a (road) transition segment where the pavement objectâ€™s linear placement along an alignment denotes the beginning location.
